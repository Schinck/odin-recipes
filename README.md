In this project I'll be introducing you guys to few a Brazilian recipes, and will use this project to practice the basics of HTML that I learned with Odin Project.

Here are what I plan to use and improve in this project:

Complete memorize a Boilerplate
Make proper use of each type of header
Make proper use of bold and italic characters
Use ordered lists and unordered lists
Properly link my pages and outside pages to the website
Use images both from the internet and images in the machine
Increase my abilities with CLI and GItHub
