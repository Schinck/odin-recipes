        <h2>Chicken teardrop</h2>
            <p>Coxinha is a popular street food snack in Brazil and is fun and <em>economical</em> to make. Think of it as savory dough shaped into a drumstick with a creamy chicken salad filling. It's then battered and fried to golden, crispy perfection.</p>
            <p>They're easy to eat on the go, they're a meal unto themselves, they have a unique appearance (simulated drumstick or teardrop), and most importantly, they are deep-fried and <strong>delicious!</strong></p>
